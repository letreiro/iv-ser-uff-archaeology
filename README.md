# VI International Seminar on Statistics with R

SER is a multidisciplinary event that integrates professionals, students, and practitioners from the most diversified knowledge areas who use data analysis.

The first edition took place in May 2016 as the initiative of a group of professors from the Fluminense Federal University, partners of other Institutions.

Since the beginning, the event is supported by CAPES (Coordination for Higher Education Staff Development).

SER event was recognized by the R Foundation (2018) for its pioneering in Latin America in bringing together an expressive number of R users.
